# Task 2 – Portfolio Website (OIBSIP)

This project was created as part of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship.  
For Task 2, I built a clean, modern, and responsive portfolio website completely using HTML and CSS.

It's designed to introduce who I am, highlight the skills I'm learning, and showcase the projects I've worked on so far.
